    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <div class="txt-padding">This is a very simple puzzle game in which the objective is to create rows or columns of 3 or more of the same geometric form. It's compatible with all models of Game Boy.</div>

    <div class="txt-padding">Each row or column of 3 is worth 1 point, a line of 4 elements is considered to be 2 lines of 3 together, so it's worth 2 points, etc. If removing a line allows another one to be removed, the combo counter increases and the score of that removal is multiplied by it. The combo counter may increase up to 9.  As soon as new geometric forms come into the screen from the top, or the chain stops, the combo counter will go back to 1.</div>

    <h5>There are 3 game modes:</h5>

    <div class="txt-padding">- Remove all: The objective is to remove all geometric forms. If there are only 1 or 2 forms of any type the game won't be able to end, and you will lose. If you remove all, you win. High scores aren't saved.</div>
    <div class="txt-padding">- Swap limit: You have to score as much points as possible until the swap counter reaches 0. High scores are saved.</div>
    <div class="txt-padding">- Time limit: You have to score as much points as possible until the time counter reaches 0. High scores are saved.</div>

    <h5>Controls:</h5>
    <div class="txt-padding">- DPAD: Move cursor</div>
    <div class="txt-padding">- A: Swap forms in the cursor</div>
    <div class="txt-padding">- B: Rotate cursor</div>
    <div class="txt-padding">- Start: Pause</div>
